  ### Description

  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

  ### Installation

   * clone the repository from GitHub (link is in the "Description" section).  
   * Install the npm "Inquirer". type into the command line "npm install inquirer" in the program folder. This will download Inquirer,  along with all of it's dependencies. Once done, you should be able to get started with using the program.

  ### Usage

   Type "node index.js" in the command line. Once done, the program will begin by asking the user for the application's title. After that, a series of more questions will be asked of the user, either by manually entering what they would like to include, or selecting from a list.  After all questions have been answered, a "Success!" message should appear, signalling to the user that their README has been created. The user will be able to find their newly constructed README in the program folder, filled with all of the info that they input. This will range from: Description, Installation, Usage, License, Tests, and Questions.
